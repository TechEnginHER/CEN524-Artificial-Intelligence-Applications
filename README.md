# CEN 524 – Artificial Intelligence & Applications Projects
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks developed as coursework for CEN 524 – Artificial Intelligence and Applications.
Each notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate a basic machine learning model using real-world datasets.

# Overview
The following mini-projects are included:

|Module|Notebook|Dataset|Algorithm / Tools
|---------|-------------|------------|--------------------
|Mod 4A1 |iris_tensorflow.ipynb |	Iris |TensorFlow Perceptron
|Mod 4B	|breast_cancer.ipynb| Breast Cancer | Wisconsin	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
|Mod 4C |	wine.ipynb | Wine Dataset |	Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model pipeline includes:

1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Splitting into training and testing sets
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Accuracy calculation and confusion matrix generation

# Technologies Used
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras
